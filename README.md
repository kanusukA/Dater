# **DATER**

## **INTRODUCTION**

Dater is an app made to keep track of the passing of days, called Journey. <br>
This application is my first project. It was made to fully understand and help gain more knowledge of jetpack compose, future Projects with more sense will emerge soon. <br>

## Showcase

The Journey can be of any kind, as long as its concerned with dates.<br> 
Here the Journey "Vacations" Lasts 21 days, the time is calculated from the current date.

Journeys can be assigned reminders. These will go along the journey and help remind occasions of different types.<br>

To make it simpler, notification times are described in the reminder box.
